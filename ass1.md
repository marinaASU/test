Question 1 : What is a class ?
a class is a way to combine data and make functions to access these data in a user-friendly way

Question 2 : How does a class accomplish abstraction, encapsulation, and data
hiding?
this occurs by putting variables that don't interface with user in a private block while putting functions needed by the user in a public block

Question 3 : What is the relationship between an object and a class?
A class defines the properties and behavior for the objects represented by the abstraction. it denotes a category of objects and act as a blueprint for creating such objects. An object exhibits the property and behaviors defined by its class. Generally, an object is an instance of a class.

Question 4 : In what way, aside from being functions, are class function members
different from class data members?
class fuctions members access class data members

Question 6 : When are class constructors called? When are class destructors
called?
a constructor is executed whenever we create new objects of that class , while a destructor is executed whenever an object of it's class goes out of scope or whenever the delete expression is applied to a pointer to the object of that class.

Question 8 :  What is a default constructor?What is the advantage of having one?
A default constructor is a function that does not have any parameter , it is called by default when creating a new object of the class , and it helps in assigning initial values for variables in the class 

Question 10 : What are this and *this?
this is a pointer to the instance of the class. *this is a reference to the same.
